{title:Description}

{p}{cmd: forest} visualizes results from multiple regressions on a single independent variable.
The resulting "forest"-style chart shows the effect of a single "treatment" variable of interest on some set of dependent variables.
It can display raw coefficients, standardized effect sizes (Cohen's {it:d}), or odds ratios (from logistic regressions).
It can also make corrections to the confidence intervals or significance estimates for family-wise error control.{p_end}

{p}{it:Note:} {cmd:forest} currently requires that the form of the estimates
are those returned by the standard {help regress} command.
That is, estimates are extracted from the first row of the `r(table)' matrix
after the estimation command. Commands that do not follow this structure
will return incorrect values.

{synoptline}
{p 4 2}{bf:Required Inputs}{p_end}{break}{break}
{synopt:{opt estimator}}Indicates the estimation command to be utilized.{p_end}{break}
{synopt:({it:depvar family})}List the left-hand-side variables in families for error control.
At least one family of dependent variables is required.{p_end}{break}
{synopt:{opt t:reatment(var)}}List the independent variable of interest
(and any material to follow the estimator and dependent variable and precede the controls, in case of commands like {help ivregress 2sls}).{p_end}{break}
{p 4 2}{bf:Additional Options}{p_end}{break}{break}
{synopt:{opt c:ontrols()}}Specify control variables.{p_end}
{break}
{synopt:{bf:or|d}}Request effect sizes as odds ratios (by exponentiating regression coefficients where possible)
or in terms of Cohen's {it:d} (by standardizing the dependent variables). (Choose only one.){p_end}
{break}
{synopt:* {opt b:onferroni}}Request confidence intervals calculated with Bonferroni correction for simultaneous comparisons.
This is calculated by adjusting the significance level to (100-5/({it:number of regressions})) per family.{p_end}
{synopt:* {opt bh}}Request Benjamini-Hochberg significance for simultaneous comparisons.
This is calculated by comparing the raw p-value against ({it:rank}/({it:number of regressions}))*0.05 per family.{p_end}
{break}

{synopt:{opt sort(type)}}Request that results be sorted from the smallest result to the largest.
The {it:local} option sorts within each family;
the {it:global} option applies the sort to all specified results.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt graph:opts()}}Set any desired options for the graph.{p_end}
{synopt:{it:est_options}}Specify any options needed for the estimator.{p_end}
{synoptline}
{p 4 4}* Both {opt b:onferroni} and {opt bh} can be specified, but they will have different results â€“
Bonferroni control will adjust the confidence intervals, and Benjamini-Hochberg control will adjust the significance.{p_end}
